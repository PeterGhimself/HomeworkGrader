# HomeworkGrader
I wrote this program in order to help me evaluate and grade homework for grades 2 and 3 while working as 
an English teacher at a Saturday School. I found the grading part of correcting very repetitive and made my own
system to speed up the process. This program takes into account the total number of mistakes, questions, and blanks.
5+ is the equivalent of an A+. The GUI was written by David Huculak and I wrote the logic behind it.
I know this program probably isn't as versatile as it can be, but it did the job well for me when I needed it.
Open to any constructive criticism or ideas on increasing the versatility of the program!
